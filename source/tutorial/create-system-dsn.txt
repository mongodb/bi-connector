The following steps describe how to create a system Data Source
Name (DSN) for the BI Connector's :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`
process. A DSN is a saved configuration which
describes a database connection to be
used by an :abbr:`ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)` driver.
Once the DSN is created for the |bi-short|, you can configure a wide
range of SQL clients and BI tools to use the DSN and import
data from MongoDB.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating a :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`, you should:

- Download and install `Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
  2015

- Download and install the |odbc-driver|
  for your platform.

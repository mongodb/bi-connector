Authentication Plugins
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The |bi| offers authentication plugins allowing you to authenticate
using the ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, or ``PLAIN``
authentication mechanisms. Install either the C or JDBC authentication
plugin depending on which is compatible with your BI Tool:

.. include:: /includes/toc/dfn-list-client-dependencies.rst

For more
information on connecting BI Tools to the |bi-short|, see
:doc:`client-applications`.

.. important::

   The use of TLS/SSL is recommended in addition to using an
   authentication plugin as:

   - The ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` mechanisms hash the
     passwords in the client plugin. All other data is in cleartext.

   - The ``PLAIN`` mechanism sends the password in cleartext.

The |bi| requires authentication when running with
:option:`--auth <mongosqld --auth>`.
When the |bi| receives a connection with authentication credentials
from a client, it passes those credentials through to the underlying
MongoDB instance.

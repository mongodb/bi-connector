Authentication Plugins
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The |bi| offers authentication plugins allowing you to authenticate
using either the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or ``PLAIN`` authentication
mechanisms. Install either the C or JDBC authentication plugin
depending on which is compatible with your BI Tool:

.. include:: /includes/toc/dfn-list-client-dependencies.rst

For more
information on connecting BI Tools to the |bi-short|, see
:doc:`client-applications`.

.. important::

   The use of TLS/SSL is recommended in addition to using an
   authentication plugin as:

   - The ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` mechanism hashes the passwords in the
     client plugin. However, all other data is in cleartext.

   - The ``PLAIN`` mechanism sends the password in cleartext.

The |bi| requires authentication when running with
:option:`--auth <mongosqld --auth>`.
When the |bi| receives a connection with authentication credentials
from a client, it passes those credentials through to the underlying
MongoDB instance.

Authentication Options
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/auth-options.rst

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: uidpwd
       name: Username and Password
       content: |

         .. example::

            To authenticate as user ``grace`` with the SCRAM-SHA-1 
            authentication mechanism, use the following username:

            .. code:: shell

               grace

            You may omit ``mechanism`` and ``source`` because 
            ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default authentication mechanism. 
            To enable ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` in your 
            :doc:`mongosqld </reference/mongosqld>` configuration 
            file.:

            .. code-block:: yaml
            
               security:
                 enabled: true

     - id: ldap
       name: LDAP
       content: |

         .. example::

            To authenticate as user ``grace`` with the LDAP 
            authentication mechanism, use the following username:

            .. code:: shell

               grace?mechanism=PLAIN&source=$external

            You may omit ``mechanism`` and ``source`` if you set these
            values in your :doc:`mongosqld </reference/mongosqld>`
            configuration file:

            .. code-block:: yaml
            
               security:
                 enabled: true
                 defaultMechanism: "PLAIN"
                 defaultSource: "$external"

     - id: kerberos
       name: Kerberos
       content: |

         .. example::

            To authenticate as user ``pat`` on the ``EXAMPLE.COM``
            Kerberos realm with the Kerberos authentication mechanism, 
            use the following username:

            .. code:: shell

               pat@EXAMPLE.COM?mechanism=GSSAPI&source=$external

            You may omit ``mechanism`` and ``source`` if you set these
            values in your :doc:`mongosqld </reference/mongosqld>`
            configuration file:

            .. code-block:: yaml
            
               security:
                 enabled: true
                 defaultMechanism: "GSSAPI"
                 defaultSource: "$external"
                 gssapi:
                   hostname: <yourHostname>
                   serviceName: "mongosql"

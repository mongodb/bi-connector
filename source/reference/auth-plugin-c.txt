Using the Plugin for Authentication
-----------------------------------

Before you use the authentication plugin, you must set up authenticated
users for MongoDB. For more information on creating authenticated users,
see  :manual:`Enable Authentication </tutorial/enable-authentication/>`.
If you are using the Atlas-hosted |bi-short|, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

The procedure for using the C Authentication plugin library varies
depending on your SQL client. The C Authentication plugin can be used
via one of the following methods:

- :doc:`DSN (Data Source Name)</tutorial/create-system-dsn>` using the
  MySQL Connector/ODBC driver. For more information, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/create-system-dsn`.

- The ``--default-auth`` option for the MySQL Shell. For more
  information, see :doc:`/connect/mysql`.

This plugin can is compatible with both the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of
the MySQL shell and MySQL Connector/ODBC driver. The installation
directory differs depending on the version you install.

You can import data from a MongoDB collection into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet with the `MongoDB Connector for BI
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=tbl#bi-connector>`_ and
an ODBC data connection.

Prerequisites

         To connect Excel to the |bi|, you must first create a system
         :doc:`Data Source Name (DSN) </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`.

         Connecting Excel to the |bi| requires the following:

         - 64-bit version of Excel. Run the following command to
           determine whether the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Excel is
           installed:

           .. code-block:: sh

              file -N /Applications/Microsoft\ Excel.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft\ Excel

           For information on upgrading to the 64-bit version of Excel,
           see `Microsoft Support <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3187505/office-2016-for-mac-64-bit-upgrade>`_.

         - Install `iODBC <http://opldownload.s3.amazonaws.com/uda/components/7.0/universal-apple-macosx10.7-32/mxkozzzz.dmg>`_.

           .. note::

              Both the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of iODBC are
              included with the installer. If you use iODBC to test your
              DSN, you must use the 64-bit version of the application.

              iODBC is not recommended for creating or modifying your
              :doc:`Data Source Name (DSN) </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`.
              To create or modify your DSN, use the ODBC Manager
              application that is included with the |odbc-driver-name|.

         - Create a :doc:`Data Source Name (DSN)
           </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`.

           .. important::

              Excel requires the following settings in your
              :doc:`Data Source Name (DSN) </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`
              configuration:

              - The ``DATABASE`` keyword must be specified in your DSN.
                If the ``DATABASE`` keyword is not set, Excel will not
                recognize any collections.

              - TLS/SSL certificates must be stored in the
                ``/Library/ODBC/`` directory. All TLS/SSL keywords in the
                DSN must point to the certificates in this directory.

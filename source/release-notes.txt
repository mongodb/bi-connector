.. !!!!! NOTE TO FOLKS UPDATING THIS !!!!!
.. The BI Connector team derives
.. the links to the release notes based on the assumption that we'll
.. use the following heading format: |bi| x.x.x

.. When you add notes for a new release, you **must** use that
.. formatting for the H3 so that the rendered target is the format they
.. expect and we don't break the links on the downloads page.
.. (DOCS-9670 for context)

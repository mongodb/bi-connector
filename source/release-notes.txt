.. !!!!! NOTE TO FOLKS UPDATING THIS !!!!!
.. The BI Connector team derives
.. the links to the release notes based on the assumption that we'll
.. use the following heading format: |bi| x.x.x

.. When you add notes for a new release, you **must** use that
.. formatting for the H3 so that the rendered target is the format they
.. expect and we don't break the links on the downloads page.
.. (DOCS-9670 for context)

.. _bi-2-5-0:

|bi| 2.5.0
----------

*Released May 23, 2018*

- Improved memory management for :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`.
- New SSPI support for :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` on Windows.
- The :option:`--sampleNamespaces  <mongosqld --sampleNamespaces>`
  option now supports :ref:`exclusion <sampling-exclusion>`.
- ``NULL`` valued types are now cast to varchar during sampling.
- Optimized ``COUNT(*)`` query performance.
- ``SIN``, ``COS``, ``TAN`` are now pushed down.

New SSPI Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows Clients may now use kerberos to authenticate against the
|bi-short|.

``NULL`` Valued Types Are Now Cast to Varchar During Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resolves the issue where queries would fail due to ``NULL`` values
being ignored during sampling. Now, ``NULL`` values will be cast as SQL
type ``VARCHAR``.

``SIN``, ``COS``, ``TAN`` Are Now Pushed Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|bi-short| will now push down ``SIN``, ``COS``, and ``TAN`` SQL
functions. This will improve performance for queries using these
functions.

.. _bi-2-4-1:

|bi| 2.4.1
----------

*Released Mar 09, 2018*

We've released version 2.4.1 of the |bi| for production deployment. This
release contains minor bug fixes for users of the |bi-short| and is a
recommended upgrade for all 2.4 users.

|bi| 2.4.0
----------

*Released Feb 21, 2018*

- Support for 3.6 Aggregate Expressions.
- Pushdown for subqueries and non-equijoins.
- Killing SQL query now also kills MongoDB operation.
- Permission changes for ``DRDL`` file users. When
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` runs with authentication enabled,
  admin credentials must be provided with the
  :option:`--mongo-username <mongosqld --mongo-username>` and
  :option:`--mongo-password <mongosqld --mongo-password>` options or
  the :setting:`mongodb.net.auth.username` and :setting:`mongodb.net.auth.password`
  settings in the :ref:`configuration file <config-format>`.

|bi| version 2.4 improves more expressive queries. New features include:

Aggregate Expressions

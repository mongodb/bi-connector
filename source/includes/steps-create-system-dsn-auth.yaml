   Click the :guilabel:`Details` button to expose the lower half of the form.

   The following form fields are required:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70

      * - Field Name
        - Description

      * - :guilabel:`Data Source Name`
        - A name of your choice.

      * - :guilabel:`TCP/IP Server`
        - Address of the server where your
          :program:`mongosqld` process is running.

      * - :guilabel:`Port`
        - Port number of your :program:`mongosqld`
          process.

      * - :guilabel:`User`
        - Required when running with :option:`--auth` enabled.
          Username of the :manual:`MongoDB user
          </core/security-users/>` who is authenticated to use the
          database named in your :doc:`schema file
          </schema-configuration>`. Append the database name to the
          username in the format:

          .. code-block:: shell

             <username>?source=<database-name>

          For example, if user ``dbUser`` is authenticated on
          database ``inventory``, the :guilabel:`User` field should
          contain the string ``dbUser?source=inventory``.

      * - :guilabel:`Password`
        - Required when running with :option:`--auth` enabled.
          The authenticated user's password.

      * - :guilabel:`Database`
        - The name of the database the user is authenticated to use.

      * - :guilabel:`Authentication`
        - Required when running with :option:`--auth` enabled.
          The default authentication method.
          To use the :doc:`authentication plugin
          </tutorial/install-auth-plugin-c>`, fill in this field with the
          string ``mongosql_auth``.

          .. note::

             The :guilabel:`Authentication` field is at the bottom
             of the form. Be careful not to miss it.

   The following example configuration assumes the following:

   - A :program:`mongosqld` instance running on ``localhost`` port
     ``3307`` with authentication enabled.
   - A :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` instance running with
     :manual:`authentication </reference/program/mongod#cmdoption-auth>` enabled.
   - A :manual:`MongoDB user </core/security-users/>` named
     ``dbUser`` who is authenticated to use the ``test``
     database.

   The values you enter may be different.

   If the connection is successful, click :guilabel:`OK` to add the
   :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`. If the connection fails,
   check to make sure your MongoDB user is correctly authenticated for
   the database named in the connection, and that the authentication
   plugin is installed.

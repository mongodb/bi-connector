  The |odbc-driver-name| files are named ``libmdbodbca.so`` and
  ``libmdbodbcw.so``. After downloading the |odbc-driver-name|,
  move them to your ``/usr/local/lib`` directory.

  The file named ``libmdbodbca.so`` is the ANSI driver, and the
  file named ``libmdbodbcw.so`` is the UNICODE driver. Specify
  the desired driver in your ``odbc.ini`` file.

  The file ``/etc/odbc.ini`` defines your Data Source Names. Below is
  an example ``odbc.ini`` file which is configured to use the
  |odbc-driver-name| with a DSN called ``MongoDBODBC``. Replace all
  necessary placeholder values with values for your system.

  .. code-block:: none

     [MongoDBODBC]
     Description = ODBC for MongoDB BI Connector
     Driver      = /usr/local/lib/libmdbodbca.so
     Trace       = Off

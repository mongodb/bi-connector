You can specify the following authentication options after your
username as URI-style query parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Connection Option
     - Description

   * - ``source``

     - Specify the name of the database which stores the user's
       credentials. If you do not specify this option, the |bi| will
       default to the current database associated with the MySQL
       connection.

       For authentication mechanisms such as |ldap| that
       delegate credential storage to other services, set the
       :urioption:`source` value to ``$external``.

   * - ``mechanism``

     - Specify the mechanism that the |bi| should use to
       authenticate the connection. Accepted values include:

       - Challenge and Response (:ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>`, the default)
       - |ldap| using |sasl| (:ref:`PLAIN <security-auth-ldap>`)
       - Kerberos (:ref:`GSSAPI <security-auth-ldap>`)

       |ldap| and Kerberos require `MongoDB Enterprise
       <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?ct=atlasheader2#enterprise>`_.
       Set the source to ``$external`` when using |ldap| or Kerberos.

       .. note:: 
          x.509 certificates are supported.

   * - System Variable
     - Data Type
     - Description
     - Default Value (Atlas-hosted)
     - Default Value (On Premises)
   * - ``full_pushdown_exec_mode``
     - boolean
     - Specifies whether a query error is returned for queries with
       clauses that aren't fully translated to MongoDB semantics. SQL
       query predicates are used to filter data returned by the query.
     - ``0 (false)``
     - ``0 (false)``
   * - ``log_level``
     - integer
     - Specifies the logging level for |bi-short|:

       - ``-1``: Do not log.
       - ``0``: Log only messages for database users, such as basic
         ``mongosqld`` events and state changes.
       - ``1``: Log messages for database users and ``mongosqld`` administrators.
       - ``2``: For internal use only.
     - ``2``
     - ``0``
   * - ``max_nested_table_depth``
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum number of unique nested field paths that
       ``mongosqld`` maps to a relational table for a collection.
     - ``50``
     - ``50``
   * - ``max_num_columns_per_table``
     - integer
     - The maximum number of unique fields that ``mongosqld`` maps to
       relational columns for a collection.
     - ``1000``
     - ``2000``
   * - ``mongodb_max_varchar_length``
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum string length returned for columns using
       the ``VARCHAR`` data type. A value of ``0`` specifies
       no limit.
     - ``0``
     - ``0``
   * - ``polymorphic_type_conversion_mode``
     - string
     - Determines how |bi-short| evaluates document fields that are
       specified with multiple data types. For example, ``count``
       could be a number in one document and a string in another.
       The data type that |bi-short| selects depends on the value
       you assign to the ``schema_mapping_heuristic`` system variable.
       A value of ``majority`` causes |bi-short| to select the type
       that appears in the majority of document fields, while a value
       of ``lattice`` would cause |bi-short| to select string as the
       data type for ``count``.

       Set ``polymorphic_type_conversion_mode`` to one of the following
       values:

       - ``off``:
         Queries may fail if you do not explicitly cast
         document fields that are specified with multiple data types.
       - ``fast``:
         |bi-short| converts only document fields that
         appeared as multiple data types during sampling.
       - ``safe``:
         |bi-short| converts all document fields to the data type
         discovered during sampling, even if the fields do not appear
         as multiple data types.
     -  ``off``
     -  ``off``
   * - ``sample_refresh_interval_secs``
     - integer
     - Specifies how frequently, in seconds, that the |bi-short| schema
       is updated. A value of ``0`` specifies that the schema is not 
       refreshed after |bi-short| starts.

       See :doc:`Cached Sampling </schema/cached-sampling>` for more
       information.
     - ``0``
     - ``0``
   * - ``sample_size``
     - integer
     - Specifies how many documents |bi-short| samples when generating
       its schema. A value of ``0`` specifies that |bi-short| performs
       a collection scan across all collections.

       See :doc:`Cached Sampling </schema/cached-sampling>` for more
       information.
     - ``1000``
     - ``100``
   * - ``schema_mapping_heuristic``
     - string
     - Specifies how the MongoDB schema is transformed into a relational
       schema:

       - ``lattice``: See :doc:`Sampling Type Conflicts </schema/type-conflicts>`
         for more information. 
       - ``majority``: |bi-short| assigns the most common data type for
         a field occuring in a sample.

     - ``lattice``
     - ``lattice``
   * - ``type_conversion_mode``
     - string
     - Specifies the semantics that |bi-short| uses for type conversions,
       such as the ``CAST`` function.

       - ``mysql``
       - ``mongosql``
     - ``mongosql``
     - ``mongosql``

  By default, Tableau installs the MySQL Connector/ODBC. Verify
  the connector is installed:

  #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Control Panel`.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Programs and Features`.
  #. Look for "MySQL Connector/ODBC 5.3" on the list of
     programs.

  If the connector is not present on the list of programs, download and
  install the `MySQL Connector/ODBC <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/5.3.html>`_.

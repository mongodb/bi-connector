title: Generate your schema definition file.
ref: generate-schema
level: 4
pre: |
  Provide a MongoDB server hostname, replace ``dbname`` with the name of your
  database, and optionally replace ``collname`` with the name of a collection.
  If you do not specify a collection, :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` will generate a
  schema from all collections in ``dbname``.
post: |
  .. note::
     The :option:`--host` option only accepts a hostname. You cannot
     provide a :ref:`MongoDB connection string <mongodb-uri>`.

  You can examine the generated ``schema.drdl`` file in a text editor
  and remove any fields or tables that are not part of your intended
  schema.

  For more information, see :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl`.
